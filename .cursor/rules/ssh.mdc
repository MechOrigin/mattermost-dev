# SSH Configuration Documentation

## Server Access Information

### Grafana-Prometheus-Node Server
- **Hostname**: alertmanager-droplet
- **IP Address**: 167.71.155.226
- **User**: root
- **SSH Key**: ~/.ssh/alertmanager_droplet
- **Quick Connect**: `ssh alertmanager-droplet`

### Mattermost Server
- **Hostname**: mattermost-droplet
- **IP Address**: 138.68.249.92
- **User**: root
- **SSH Key**: ~/.ssh/mattermost_droplet
- **Quick Connect**: `ssh mattermost-droplet`

## SSH Configuration
The SSH configuration is stored in `~/.ssh/config` with the following settings:

```
Host mattermost-droplet
  HostName 138.68.249.92
  User root
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/mattermost_droplet

Host alertmanager-droplet
  HostName 167.71.155.226
  User root
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/alertmanager_droplet
```

## SSH Keys
- **Alertmanager Key Location**:
  - Private: `~/.ssh/alertmanager_droplet`
  - Public: `~/.ssh/alertmanager_droplet.pub`

- **Mattermost Key Location**:
  - Private: `~/.ssh/mattermost_droplet`
  - Public: `~/.ssh/mattermost_droplet.pub`

## Security Best Practices
1. **Private Key Protection**:
   - Keep private keys secure and never share them
   - Set appropriate permissions (600) on private keys
   - Store private keys only on trusted devices

2. **Key Management**:
   - Regularly audit authorized keys on servers
   - Remove unused or outdated keys
   - Use unique keys for each server for better security isolation

3. **Server Configuration**:
   - Password authentication is disabled in favor of key-based authentication
   - Root login is permitted only with SSH keys
   - Regular security updates should be maintained

## Troubleshooting
If SSH connection fails:
1. Check key permissions (`chmod 600` for private keys)
2. Verify server connectivity (`ping <server-ip>`)
3. Ensure the correct key is being used
4. Check server's SSH service status
5. Verify your public key is in the server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

## Backup Procedures
1. Keep secure backups of:
   - SSH private keys
   - SSH configuration file
   - Known hosts file
2. Store backups in a secure, encrypted location
3. Document key recovery procedures

## Maintenance
1. **Regular Tasks**:
   - Monitor SSH logs for unauthorized access attempts
   - Update SSH configuration as needed
   - Rotate SSH keys periodically (recommended: every 6-12 months)

2. **Security Audits**:
   - Review authorized keys regularly
   - Check SSH daemon configuration
   - Monitor for unusual access patterns

## Emergency Access
In case of SSH key issues:
1. DigitalOcean console access is available as a backup
2. Keep emergency contact information for server administrators
3. Document recovery procedures for key loss scenarios
