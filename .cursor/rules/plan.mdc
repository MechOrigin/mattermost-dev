 - Everytime you want to make changes to files, create a plan and ask my permission to proceed.

- A good plan isn't magical, it's methodical. Take your time to look at the issue from all of the angles, and create a succinct bulleted overview of the changes that you want to make and the benefits that they'll give us.

- You are allowed and encouraged to properly search through the codebase for the relevant code before you create the plan.



### Testing Setup
- Jest configuration
- React Testing Library
- Error boundary tests
- Store unit tests
