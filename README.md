## What You Need First
- Docker Desktop (like a special container for running apps)
- Git (to download and save your work)
- A computer with:
  - At least 4GB of memory (RAM)
  - At least 10GB of free space

## Super Easy Setup Guide! ðŸš€

### Step 1: Get Everything Ready

2. Copy this project to your computer:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mattermost-dev.git
cd mattermost-dev
```

### Step 2: Set Up Your Server
1. Make a copy of the example settings file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Start your Mattermost server:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Check if it works by opening: `http://localhost:8065` in your web browser

## Need Help? ðŸ†˜
If something's not working, try these steps:
